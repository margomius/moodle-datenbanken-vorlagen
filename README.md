# Presets for the Moodle Database Activity

A collection of presets to use in the Database Activity in [Moodle](https://moodle.org/).

## Description

Each folder is a different database preset and contains

* Folder: "Preset" = Folder with the preset files
* File: "[Name of preset].zip" = zip-archiv to import into database activity

## How To

From Moodle-Docs: [Importing a preset](https://docs.moodle.org/401/en/Building_Database#Importing_a_preset)

* When creating a new Database activity, click the button Import preset on the starter page once you have saved your settings.
* Alternatively, click the link Presets in the Database activity navigation.
* After the import, you can customise the fields and, if needed, add or import entries.

You will see a "Overwrite current settings" checkbox after the "Import" button has been pressed. If checked/ticked, the Database activity overwrites some of its current general settings by those stored in the preset. 

## Dependencies

* A bootstrap based Moodle Theme (like the [standard themes](https://docs.moodle.org/401/en/Standard_themes) Boost and Classic)
* **Optional:** Source-code editor to make adjustments
